A "library" to read HSPICE measurements (.mt0, mt1, ..., mtX) and optionally, convert to CSV.

... This was implemented when I didn't know about
.option measform=3
option, which makes HSPICE save the ouptut in CSV format in the first place!
Still, perhaps someone might find this useful.

Python implementation of mt2csv, since it is simpler than coding them in C.

usage:
./mt2csv.py s38584.mt0 s38584.csv

lex, yacc is still here for you, though.
