Yet another MT2CSV implementation, because it is FAST
and RELIABLE to compile at different systems.

mt0 files are HSPICE simulation measurement result.
Although it is plain text,
it's not really straight forward to process using excel or
any other custom programs.
This program will convert mt0 files to csv (comma separated file) files.

usage:
./mt2csv < s38584.mt0 > s38584.csv
or equivalently,
cat s38584.mt0 | ./mt2csv > s38584.csv
